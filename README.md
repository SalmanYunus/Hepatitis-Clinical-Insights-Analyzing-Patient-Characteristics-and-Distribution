# Hepatitis-Domain-Analyzing-Patient-Characteristics-and-Distribution

### Introduction:
Hepatitis is a general term for inflammation of the liver, which can be caused byvarious factors including viruses, alcohol, and autoimmune disorders. It is a major public healthconcern affecting millions of people worldwide. This report investigates the characteristics anddistribution of patients with hepatitis based on the "Hepatitis Domain" dataset. This reportinvestigates the characteristics and distribution of patients with hepatitis based on the"Hepatitis Domain" dataset. The dataset comprises 20 attributes, all of which are numerical orfloat values.

### Dataset Background:
Dataset provides information about patients diagnosed with hepatitis,potentially offering insights into the disease's characteristics and risk factors. The datasetcomprises 20 attributes, all of which are numerical or float values. Each attribute represents aspecific aspect of a patient's diagnosis and medical history. Understanding the data types andmeaning behind each attribute is crucial for effectively analyzing the dataset and drawingmeaningful conclusions.

### Data Analysis performed on the Hepatitis dataset:
1. Visualization the distribution of patients across three different Age groups.  
2. Overall proportion of patients who Survived vs Died.  
3. Relationship between Age and Patient outcomes in the Hepatitis data.  
4. Distribution of patient outcomes ("Alive" vs. "Dead") across genders.  
5. See the distribution of patients across all combinations of "Class", "STEROID", and"ANTIVIRALS". Identify potential differences in survival outcomes between treatmentgroups within each "Class".  
6. Identify Most Frequent Symptoms and Visualization of Symptom Frequency.  
7. Analyzing Age-Specific Symptom Prevalence and their visualization.  
8. Understanding Gender-Specific Symptom Patterns for Identifying gender-specific riskfactors and Improving diagnosis and communication.  
9. Analyze HISTOLOGY distribution across genders and Understanding gender disparities indisease burden.  
10. Analyzing Symptom Prevalence , Co-occurrences and Understanding symptom patterns.  
11. Exploring Relationships between Lab Tests and Categories.  
12. Evaluate and Compare the Performance of two Machine Learning Models LogisticRegression and Random Forest, on the Hepatitis dataset for predicting patient Class(Alive/Dead).  
13. Evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment combinations (steroid and antiviral) onpatient outcomes within specific subgroups defined by age, gender, or symptom profiles.  
14. Identify patient subgroups with high-risk profiles for targeted interventions andpreventative measures.  
15. Evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment combinations on patient outcomes within specific subgroups.
